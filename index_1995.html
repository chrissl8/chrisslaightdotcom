            Web Developer known as Chris Slaight, born and raised in Staten Island, New York. Currently working in the
            world of software support, ready to make a career change into software development. Outside of work, I
            generally like to spend time with my girlfriend, family and friends in whatever adventures that we find
            ourselves in.

            Being happy and satisfied about what you do in life is very important to me, maybe not being happy every
            minute of every day but at least feeling like you're doing something you enjoy and making a difference.
